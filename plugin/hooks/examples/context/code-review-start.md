### Additional Security Checks

For this project, code reviews MUST verify:

1. **Authentication:** All API endpoints require valid JWT
2. **Input Validation:** All user inputs use allowlist validation
3. **Rate Limiting:** Public endpoints have rate limits configured
4. **Logging:** No PII in application logs

### Performance Requirements

- Database queries: No N+1 patterns
- API response time: < 200ms for p95
- Memory usage: No leaks detected in tests

### Documentation

- Public APIs have JSDoc/TSDoc comments
- Complex algorithms have inline explanations
- Breaking changes noted in CHANGELOG.md
